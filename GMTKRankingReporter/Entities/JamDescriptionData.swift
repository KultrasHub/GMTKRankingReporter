The game jam is centered on a theme, this is meant to restrict developers and encourage creativity",
    "The host of the Jam for this application was GTMK with the theme: Roll of the Dice. This was a challenging theme, as it suggestes randomness, probability and might take away players agency and discourage strategy and thinking. \n More detail of the Jam: \n This game jam was about making a game during a 48 hour period. This jam began on July 15th at 18:00BST and ended on July 17th at 18:00 BST. \n Games would be ranked based on the enjoyment, creativity and presentation criterias. \n Pre-existing code and art, audio were allowed, but best participants should work with the spirit of the jam.",
    "This app will present you the top 20 GMTK's favourite games. The result is incredible, participants coped with randomess and probability thoughtfully. Take Rolling for royalty as an  example, the game allow players to make their own dice and this decision promote strategy and critical thinking to win. Although players still have to play with randomness as they roll the dice, but the agency has been carefully implemented."
